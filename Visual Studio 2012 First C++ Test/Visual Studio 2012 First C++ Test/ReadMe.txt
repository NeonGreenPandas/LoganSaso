    CONSOLE APPLICATION : Visual Studio 2012 First C++ Test Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this Visual Studio 2012 First C++ Test application for you.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your Visual Studio 2012 First C++ Test application.


Visual Studio 2012 First C++ Test.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

Visual Studio 2012 First C++ Test.vcxproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

Visual Studio 2012 First C++ Test.cpp
    This is the main application source file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named Visual Studio 2012 First C++ Test.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.
